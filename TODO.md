# Paper Trading Webpage - Task List

## Introduction

This document outlines the tasks required for implementing the Paper Trading Webpage project, a TypeScript-based web application that enables paper trading through TradingView webhook integration. Tasks are organized by priority levels:

- **High Priority**: Core functionality essential for basic system operation
- **Medium Priority**: Important features that enhance system usability and reliability
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features and improvements

- [ ] Create mobile-responsive layout

## Task Dependencies

Many tasks have dependencies on other components. Here's a general order of implementation:

1. Data Models → Core Trading Engine → Webhook Integration
2. Testing Infrastructure → Feature Implementation
3. Documentation → API Finalization
4. Enhanced Features → UI/UX Improvements

## Notes

- All implementations should follow TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Create unit tests for all new features
